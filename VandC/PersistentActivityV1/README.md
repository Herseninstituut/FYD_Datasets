## Persistent Activity in V1


# DMTP:  Delayed Match To Position

The monkey sees a concentric gabor somewhere on the screen for a short period of time. This presentation is followed by a blank screen for about a second, after which a grid of concentric gabors appears (response grid). One of the gabors in the response grid is in the same position as the sample gabor. The monkey is required to make an eye movement to this matching gabor. The distance between gabors in the response grid is varied in blocks of about 150 trials. We expect to see memory activity in V1 during the delay period, and we expect its size to depend on the condition (spacing in response grid). The first half of each block has a gray background, the second half has a white noise pattern background.
