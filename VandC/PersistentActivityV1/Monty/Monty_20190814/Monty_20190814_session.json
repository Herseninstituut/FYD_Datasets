	"notes": "We are using the RZ2 system with the 8 32-channel zif clip headstages. There are two connectors, 4 zif clips each. One goes to the lower channel numbers on the PZ2 amplifier (connector 1), the other one goes to the high channel nummbers on the PZ2 (connector 2). Connector 1 will connect to the posterior connector, connector 2 to the anterior connector, because that way low connects to low, and high to high. We will test 5 reference options: \r\n- all arrays referenced to refA on connector 1 (block 1)\r\n- all arrays refB on connector 1 (block 2)\r\n- all arrays refA on connector 2 (block 3)\r\n- all arrays refB on connector 2 (block 4)\r\n- each array referenced to it's own local reference (block 5)\r\nBlock 6 is nothing\r\n"
